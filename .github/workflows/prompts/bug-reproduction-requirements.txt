Given a bug report title and description for the useAudioPlayer package, return 'pass' if there is enough information to reliably reproduce the issue.

4. A set of clear steps for how the issue can be reproduced

If any of these elements are missing, unclear or lack sufficient levels of detail, write a friendly response to the author including a brief description of what is missing from the bug report instead of 'pass'.
