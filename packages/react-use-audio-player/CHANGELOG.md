## 4.0.2 (2025-03-16)

### Fixes üêõ

- Fixes issue [#166](https://github.com/E-Kuerschner/useAudioPlayer/issues/166) in which the hook can get stuck in a loading state after seeking on an audio resource loaded via HTML5 audio elements 
- Fixes issue [#105](https://github.com/E-Kuerschner/useAudioPlayer/issues/105) in which seeking on streaming audio would cause an error

### Other

## 4.0.1 (2025-03-02)

### Fixes üêõ

- Fixes an issue where while using the optional arguments of `useAudioPlayer`, the audio could be left stuck in an unloaded state due to React StrictMode
- Stabilizes the hook state during hydration to better support server-side rendered frameworks

### Other

- Add new `remix-app` example to the demos folder. To run: `yarn workspace remix-app start`

## 4.0.0 (2025-02-25)

Version 4.0 marks a big shift for the react-use-audio-player package.
In this version, we've adopted a modern version of React, 
rewritten the internals to align with the best practices of modern React and pivoted away from an over-reliance on global state.

### Breaking üí£

- Bump React peer dependency version. The min React version is now >= 18.0.0
- Delete deprecated `useGlobalAudioPlayer`. Consumers must migrate to `useAudioPlayerContext`
- Rename several `AudioPlayer` state properties for consistency
  - `playing` => `isPlaying`
  - `muted` => `isMuted`
  - `paused` => `isPaused`
  - `stopped` => `isStopped`
  - `looping` => `isLooping`

### New Features üöÄ

- New properties and methods on `AudioPlayer`
  - `isUnloaded`
  - explicit `loopOn`, `loopOff` functions
  - explicit `mute`, `unmute` functions
  - escape hatch for accessing underlying Howl object via `player`
  - toggle functions for certain states: `toggleLoop`, `toggleMute`, `togglePlayPause`
- New optional arguments for useAudioPlayer to declaratively load audio

## 3.0.0 (2025-01-05)

This set of changes is intened to be non-breaking, but due to using a different bundler (tsup) I decided to release this as a major version as the exported files from the package have technically changed. 
Please report any issue using this new version.
